> Conflict Plan
*What will your group do when it encounters conflict?

*If conflicts arise, we will do our best to resolve them in a timely manner.

*How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

*In our group, everyone is an adult and will be treated like so. It is up to each member to decide what they want to work on and how much they can handle. If a member is not adequately contributing, we will make an effort to have a group talk about what is happening and what can be done so they can contribute more.

*What is your process to resolve conflicts?

*If a conflict between individuals arise, we will talk share our conflicting views and try to come to a compromise/decision. If neither side is convinced, we will bring it up in a group setting and let the group vote for a decision. If the votes are even, we can flip a coin.

*How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?

*We will try to keep discussions of conflicting ideas under 15 minutes so we do not waste time. If a conflict goes over 15 minutes, we will escalate it to a group discussion and vote.

> Communication Plan:
*How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

*After hours and on the weekend, we plan on being conscious of Slack.

*We will use Slack to message each other regarding important details of the project. If need, we can exchange emails and phone numbers.

*What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?

*As a team we will try to include everyone’s ideas and vote on decisions. We will get together as a group at least once a day and voice our ideas.

*How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

*Psychological safety is a principle we have all been aware of since kids. We aim to be comfortable around each other, so no one is afraid of speaking up. On the other side of that, we will all aim to be receptive of each other’s ideas and to hear them out fully, so we do not pre-maturely reject them.
